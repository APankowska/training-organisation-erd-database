 * Trainer allocation to courses
 * Student course bookings
 * Room allocation for courses
 * Optional accommodation for selected bookings
 * Student questions related to courses
# Deliverables
 * ['Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)'](ERD training organisation.pdf)
 * ['Documented design assumptions'](assumptions.pdf)
# Notes
This project was originally developed as part of an academic assessment. The ERD and assumptions are presented in their original form without modification.
